# LIDAR_23_Cloud_point

## Point Cloud
Point clouds are distributed spatial coordinates that can resemble a particular object or a shape when assembled. They feature important applications in domains like autonomous vehicles, terrain modeling, drone navigation, etc. However, unlike their 3D mesh counterpart, point clouds are independently distributed points in space. Thus NN network needs to ignore the permutation changes and the corresponding rigid body transformations.

This is example of how cloud points look like for an airplane.


Our goal is to develope better algorithm than the existing architecture which are capable of capturing the toplogy of such 3d space point structure and capable of doing both  better classification and segmentation.
