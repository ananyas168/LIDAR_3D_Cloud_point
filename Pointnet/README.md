#About Pointnet Architecture:
Pointnet architecture has two main subunits.
  1. Tnet 
  2. Transform
  
  You can find the code for these two classes in here.
  
Both of these work together to build the PointNet architecture. Pointnet achieves better accuracy than the other voxel based model due to the global information sharing capability which was lacks in voxel models.
